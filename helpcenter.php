                <li>Here are some things to try: </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>1. Check that your shipping address is correct </strong> Log in to your account and check your orders to ensure the order has the correct delivery address. You can check this on “My Orders” page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> 2. Check around your home, building and check with neighbors </strong> Boxes may have been left behind doors, hidden behind a tree, or dropped off at your neighbor’s house. Check with your neighbors to see if anyone has received your package.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> 3. Give it six days </strong> Sometimes carriers accidentally scan the packages that are still in transit. This means your package can be marked as “delivered” when it is still on the way to you. Your package will likely show up in the next 7 days.
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
